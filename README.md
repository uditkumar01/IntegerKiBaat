# iChat
Tired of that typical clubhouse! Where the discussion is never saved? or gets saved but becomes difficult to share it with other people after the room is closed? as they are mostly audio conversations, where everyone can't talk at the same time. It would be such a chaos if everyone did that. :)

Want a better solution that is user-friendly? and allows you to  save chats and share them at the same time?

Try using **iChat**
It is a chatting app that provides clubhouse-like features.

**Steps**
1. Create a room for live conversations. Invite everyone by sharing your room's unique Id.
2. See all the active participants and have fun conversations.
3. Freeze the chat once you are done and it is forever saved for everyone who took part in it.
4. New users can join even after the room is freezed. But, they can't add new messages.
