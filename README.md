# iChat
Tired of that typical clubhouse! Where the chat never gets saved? or gets saved but becomes difficult to share it with other people after the room is closed? as they are mostly audio clubhouses with audio conversations, everyone can't talk at the same time. It causes chaos if everyone did that.
Plus there is always such chaos happening.

Wanted a better solution that is user-friendly?plus Able to save chats and share at the same time?

Try using **iChat**
It is a chatting app that provides clubhouse-like features.

**Steps**
1. Create a room for live conversations. Invite everyone by sharing your room's unique Id.
2. See all the active participants and have fun conversations.
3. Freeze the chat once you are done and it is forever saved for everyone who took part in it.
